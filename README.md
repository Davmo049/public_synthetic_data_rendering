# public_synthetic_data_rendering
Code for rendering synthetic data for "Probabilistic 3d regression with projected huber distribution"

The material and 3d models as well as the base scene is the same as for clevr-dataset-get (https://github.com/facebookresearch/clevr-dataset-gen)
copy their image_generation/data to this folder.

Install blender, I used 3.4.1

run
```
run_backup_render.py --blender_path <BLENDER_PATH>
```

where "BLENDER_PATH" is the path to the blender executable.
